## Summary

Deferred: recipe documentation postponed to focus on agentctl parity.

## Context

User requested to pause new recipe work and prioritize agentctl parity work.

## Scope

- No implementation; task closed as deferred per request.

## Risks

- Documentation for feature-spec-to-tasks remains missing until rescheduled.

## Verify Steps

No tests required (task deferred).

## Rollback Plan

Reopen task if recipe documentation becomes a priority.
