## Summary

Added a minimal ROADMAP.md that points to current audits/docs and clarifies that milestones are tracked via tasks.

## Scope

ROADMAP.md (new minimal roadmap overview and references).

## Risks

Roadmap is now high-level; future milestones must be added explicitly to keep the file useful.

## Verify Steps

Review ROADMAP.md for accuracy and references.

## Rollback Plan

Remove ROADMAP.md or revert the commit to restore prior state.
