## Summary

Documented Node CLI recipes usage and explain command across recipe docs and command references.

## Scope

docs/recipes-how-it-works.mdx; docs/recipes-spec.mdx; docs/commands.mdx; docs/cli-contract.mdx.

## Risks

Documentation can drift if recipes behavior changes; keep references up to date.

## Verify Steps

Manual review of recipe docs and command references.

## Rollback Plan

Revert documentation updates if they conflict with CLI behavior.
