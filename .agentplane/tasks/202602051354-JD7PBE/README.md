## Summary

Document task index cache location and purpose in developer docs.

## Scope

Update docs/developer/project-layout.mdx with task index cache details.

## Risks

Docs drift if cache location changes; keep entry concise.

## Verify Steps

- Open docs/developer/project-layout.mdx and confirm cache entry present.

## Verification

Verified on 2026-02-05: docs/developer/project-layout.mdx updated with cache entry.

## Rollback Plan

Remove cache entry from docs if index is reverted.
