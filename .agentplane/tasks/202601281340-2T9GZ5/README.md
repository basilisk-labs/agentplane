## Summary

Assessed ROADMAP.md against the current codebase and reported completed vs remaining work.

## Scope

- Review ROADMAP.md goals and AP tasks
- Scan core code/docs/tests for implementation evidence
- Summarize done vs remaining items

## Risks

Assessment can become stale if roadmap or code changes; re-check before major planning.

## Verify Steps

Manual review of ROADMAP.md and key code/docs; no automated tests.

## Rollback Plan

No code changes; nothing to roll back.

## Plan
