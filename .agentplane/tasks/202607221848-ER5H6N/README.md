    Define digest-addressed KnowledgeRef contracts

    RF-08: standardize reproducible references into the existing context knowledge plane with digest, reason, retrieval provenance, score, requirement, freshness, and bounded excerpts.
  Scope: |-
    - In scope: KnowledgeRef schema/types/fixtures, resolver and digest/freshness validation, retrieval provenance, optional score, reason/required semantics, prepared excerpt metadata, and preservation of context-pack.md as a distinct assimilation artifact.
    - Out of scope: FTS implementation, semantic reranking, or a second wiki/CAS.
  Plan: |-
    1. Define the canonical ref grammar and versioned KnowledgeRef schema.
    2. Resolve refs through existing context show/storage adapters and validate digests/freshness.
    3. Add bounded excerpt and omission/missing receipts without copying durable knowledge into a new plane.
    4. Thread refs through prepared runtime contracts behind compatibility views.
    5. Add exact, stale, missing, alias, graph, and source fixtures.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Resolve each supported knowledge kind by canonical ref. Expected: the returned object matches the stored digest and source identity.
    2. Modify or remove a referenced item. Expected: stale and missing states are explicit and cannot be presented as fresh context.
    3. Build a runtime excerpt. Expected: it records reason, source span, digest, limits, and omitted/missing receipt while context-pack.md remains unchanged.
    4. Run `bun run schemas:check`, focused context contract tests, and `bun run typecheck`.
  Verification: |-

## Summary

Define digest-addressed KnowledgeRef contracts

RF-08: standardize reproducible references into the existing context knowledge plane with digest, reason, retrieval provenance, score, requirement, freshness, and bounded excerpts.

## Scope

- In scope: KnowledgeRef schema/types/fixtures, resolver and digest/freshness validation, retrieval provenance, optional score, reason/required semantics, prepared excerpt metadata, and preservation of context-pack.md as a distinct assimilation artifact.
- Out of scope: FTS implementation, semantic reranking, or a second wiki/CAS.

## Plan

1. Define the canonical ref grammar and versioned KnowledgeRef schema.
2. Resolve refs through existing context show/storage adapters and validate digests/freshness.
3. Add bounded excerpt and omission/missing receipts without copying durable knowledge into a new plane.
4. Thread refs through prepared runtime contracts behind compatibility views.
5. Add exact, stale, missing, alias, graph, and source fixtures.

## Verify Steps

1. Resolve each supported knowledge kind by canonical ref. Expected: the returned object matches the stored digest and source identity.
2. Modify or remove a referenced item. Expected: stale and missing states are explicit and cannot be presented as fresh context.
3. Build a runtime excerpt. Expected: it records reason, source span, digest, limits, and omitted/missing receipt while context-pack.md remains unchanged.
4. Run `bun run schemas:check`, focused context contract tests, and `bun run typecheck`.

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the task implementation commit(s) while preserving unrelated task and migration state.
- Restore the previous compatibility view or persisted contract version.
- Re-run focused contract, migration, and type checks.
