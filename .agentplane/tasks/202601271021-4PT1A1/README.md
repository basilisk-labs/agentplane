description: "Convert docs/ markdown to Mintlify-ready pages: add required YAML frontmatter, ensure heading hierarchy (start at H2), create Mintlify navigation config (docs/docs.json), and update internal links so the docs render correctly in Mintlify."

## Summary

- Docs are already in Mintlify-ready format with docs.json navigation.\n- Closing the migration task as completed.

## Scope

- Validate Mintlify frontmatter and headings.\n- Ensure docs.json navigation and links are in place.

## Risks

- Future doc additions might need Mintlify frontmatter updates.\n- Navigation may drift if docs.json is not maintained.

## Verify Steps

- Review docs/ frontmatter and docs/docs.json

## Rollback Plan

- Reopen if Mintlify docs format needs rework.\n- Re-apply frontmatter and navigation changes.
