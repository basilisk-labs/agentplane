## Summary

Translate ROADMAP.md into English and commit as a standalone docs task.

## Scope

Translate all sections and bullets in ROADMAP.md without changing structure or intent.

## Risks

Risk: meaning drift in translation; mitigate by keeping technical terms and structure intact.

## Verify Steps

Review ROADMAP.md for completeness and consistent terminology; no code tests required.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the translation commit to restore prior language.
