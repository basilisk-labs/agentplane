## Summary

Document the tag-triggered release flow and GitHub Release automation.

## Scope

Update developer release documentation to describe tagging, checks, npm publish, and GitHub Release creation.

## Risks

Docs may diverge from actual workflow behavior if not updated.

## Verification

Updated release-and-publishing docs to reflect tag-based publish checks and GitHub Release creation.

## Rollback Plan

Revert documentation edits if inaccurate.
