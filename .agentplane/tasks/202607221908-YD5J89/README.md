    Migrate context and evaluator command boundaries

    RF-24/RF-25 vertical slice: give context/evaluator operations granular knowledge/backend/Git/policy capabilities and typed in-process results/renderers.
  Scope: |-
    - In scope: context search/show/ingest/reindex/wiki/graph/doctor and evaluator prepare/apply/run compatibility commands, typed use cases, granular capabilities, output renderers, and elimination of subprocess/stdout orchestration in this family.
    - Out of scope: runner/Hermes, general task lifecycle, or provider/release commands.
  Plan: |-
    1. Declare exact context/evaluator capability sets and ports.
    2. Reuse typed supervisor, journal, retrieval, and evaluator use cases.
    3. Separate CLI parsing/rendering from result application.
    4. Remove direct OS/Git/network access and internal command subprocesses.
    5. Run context/evaluator schema, fixture, rendering, and capability tests.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Invoke migrated context/evaluator use cases in-process. Expected: typed results and no stdout capture/subprocess.
    2. Run human/JSON snapshots and schema fixtures. Expected: approved compatibility plus explicit v0.7 versions.
    3. Attempt mutation from read-only evaluator or undeclared context capability. Expected: typed denial.
    4. Run context/evaluator tests, schemas, guards, and typecheck.
  Verification: |-

    - Revert this family through explicit typed compatibility adapters without deleting context data or evaluation evidence.
    - Preserve journals and schema versions.
    - Re-run context integrity and evaluator staleness tests.

## Summary

Migrate context and evaluator command boundaries

RF-24/RF-25 vertical slice: give context/evaluator operations granular knowledge/backend/Git/policy capabilities and typed in-process results/renderers.

## Scope

- In scope: context search/show/ingest/reindex/wiki/graph/doctor and evaluator prepare/apply/run compatibility commands, typed use cases, granular capabilities, output renderers, and elimination of subprocess/stdout orchestration in this family.
- Out of scope: runner/Hermes, general task lifecycle, or provider/release commands.

## Plan

1. Declare exact context/evaluator capability sets and ports.
2. Reuse typed supervisor, journal, retrieval, and evaluator use cases.
3. Separate CLI parsing/rendering from result application.
4. Remove direct OS/Git/network access and internal command subprocesses.
5. Run context/evaluator schema, fixture, rendering, and capability tests.

## Verify Steps

1. Invoke migrated context/evaluator use cases in-process. Expected: typed results and no stdout capture/subprocess.
2. Run human/JSON snapshots and schema fixtures. Expected: approved compatibility plus explicit v0.7 versions.
3. Attempt mutation from read-only evaluator or undeclared context capability. Expected: typed denial.
4. Run context/evaluator tests, schemas, guards, and typecheck.

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

- Revert this family through explicit typed compatibility adapters without deleting context data or evaluation evidence.
- Preserve journals and schema versions.
- Re-run context integrity and evaluator staleness tests.
