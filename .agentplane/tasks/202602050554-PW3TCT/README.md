## Summary

Track completion of Epic B (update-check cache and integration).

## Scope

Ensure AP-010a/AP-010b/AP-010c are complete and verified.

## Risks

Risk: missing linkage between subtasks and epic; mitigated by explicit finish note.

## Verify Steps

Confirm AP-010a/AP-010b/AP-010c are DONE and hooks/tests passed.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the Epic B commits in order to restore previous update-check behavior.
