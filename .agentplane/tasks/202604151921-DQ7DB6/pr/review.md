## Summary

Commit task README with branch_pr PR packet artifacts

Reproduce the branch_pr path where pr open auto-commits .agentplane/tasks/<task-id>/pr/** but leaves the active task README untracked on the task branch, then make the task packet self-contained so task branches carry the README needed for closeout without relying on fallback recovery.
