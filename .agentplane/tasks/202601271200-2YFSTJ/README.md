## Summary

Add guard commands and git-status helpers for allowlisted staged commits.

## Scope

CLI guard subcommands for clean/suggest/commit; core git status helpers; tests and help updates.

## Plan


## Verify Steps

bun run ci

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

git revert <commit>

## Findings


## Risks

Guard may block commits if allowlist parsing mismatches git status output.
