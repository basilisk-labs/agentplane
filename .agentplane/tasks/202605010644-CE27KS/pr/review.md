## Summary

AP-00: Record 0.4 refactor execution backlog

Create traceable executable tasks for the Agentplane 0.4 refactor wave without touching unrelated DESIGN.md drift.

## Scope

- In scope: Create traceable executable tasks for the Agentplane 0.4 refactor wave without touching unrelated DESIGN.md drift.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "AP-00: Record 0.4 refactor execution backlog".

## Verification

### Plan

1. Run `agentplane task list && git status --short --untracked-files=no`. Expected: it succeeds and confirms the requested outcome for this task.
2. Review the changed artifact or behavior for the `code` task. Expected: the requested outcome is visible and matches the approved scope.
3. Compare the final result against the task summary and touched scope. Expected: remaining follow-up is either resolved or explicit in ## Findings.

### Current Status

- State: ok
- Note: Command: agentplane task list --status TODO --owner CODER; git status --short --untracked-files=no. Result: pass. Evidence: 17 dependent CODER tasks exist; tracked drift remains limited to pre-existing DESIGN.md. Scope: task graph creation.

## Risks

- Risk level: not recorded
- Breaking change: no

### Rollback

- Revert task-related commit(s).
- Re-run required checks to confirm rollback safety.
