## Summary

Compile AGENTS and CLAUDE gateway from modules

Replace direct gateway template copying with module-based gateway assembly while preserving AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md entrypoint semantics.

## Scope

- In scope: Replace direct gateway template copying with module-based gateway assembly while preserving AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md entrypoint semantics.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Compile AGENTS and CLAUDE gateway from modules".

## Plan
