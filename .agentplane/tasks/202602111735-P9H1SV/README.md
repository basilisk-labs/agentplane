## Summary

Coordinate release pipeline hardening across parity gates, doctor invariants, release observability, and significant file coverage checks.

## Context

Follow-up hardening after recent release incidents and manual verification overhead.

## Scope

In scope: tasks PNX4VA, 45RQ16, T9AQY4, 85Z1NA and integrated verification outcomes.

## Plan

1) Complete release parity gate task. 2) Complete doctor invariant task. 3) Complete release report task. 4) Complete significant coverage gate task. 5) Close epic.

## Verify Steps

Confirm child tasks PNX4VA, 45RQ16, T9AQY4, 85Z1NA are DONE and corresponding verifications passed.

## Verification

All child tasks completed and validated.

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

Reopen failed child task and revert its commits if regression is found.

## Findings

### Decisions
- Prioritized deterministic gates over broad heuristic checks.
### Implementation Notes
- Epic closed after child task completion.

## Risks

Low; all changes are incremental guardrails with dedicated tests.
