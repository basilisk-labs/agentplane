## Summary

Draft release notes for v0.1.5 based on v0.1.4..HEAD changes.

## Scope

Create docs/releases/v0.1.5.md with concise user-facing highlights.

## Risks

Release notes may omit important changes if commit scan misses user-facing impact.

## Verify Steps

Review docs/releases/v0.1.5.md for accuracy vs git log v0.1.4..HEAD.

## Verification

Reviewed docs/releases/v0.1.5.md against git log v0.1.4..HEAD.

## Rollback Plan

Remove docs/releases/v0.1.5.md if notes are incorrect.
