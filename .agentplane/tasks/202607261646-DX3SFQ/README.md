## Summary

Allow targeted cleanup of registered sibling task worktrees

Fix branch_pr post-merge cleanup when a clean base checkout shares the Git common directory with a task worktree located below another registered base checkout. Accept only a canonical Git-registered worktree with the same common directory in the explicit targeted/finalize lane; retain fail-closed rejection for arbitrary external paths, foreign repositories, current worktrees, and dirty worktrees. Add regression and negative tests.

## Scope

- In scope: Fix branch_pr post-merge cleanup when a clean base checkout shares the Git common directory with a task worktree located below another registered base checkout. Accept only a canonical Git-registered worktree with the same common directory in the explicit targeted/finalize lane; retain fail-closed rejection for arbitrary external paths, foreign repositories, current worktrees, and dirty worktrees. Add regression and negative tests.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Allow targeted cleanup of registered sibling task worktrees".

## Plan

1. Trace cleanup candidate derivation and prove the exact task worktree comes from the repository's registered worktree list.
2. Permit only explicit targeted/finalize cleanup of a registered sibling task worktree with the same Git common directory; preserve rejection for arbitrary external, foreign, current, and dirty worktrees.
3. Add regression coverage for the clean sibling-base finalization route and retain negative security coverage.
4. Run focused cleanup tests, typecheck, lifecycle invariants, guards, routing validation, and relevant full CI.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold. Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the changed artifact or behavior for the `code` task. Expected: the requested outcome is visible and matches the approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for the `code` task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched scope.
3. Compare the final result against the task summary and scope. Expected: any remaining follow-up is explicit in ## Findings.

## Rollback Plan

- Re-run required checks to confirm rollback safety.
