---
## Summary

Move the order direction toggle into the control deck navbar for quicker access.

## Context

The order indicator currently sits in the filter grid; the request is to place it near Refresh Stream.

## Scope

- Relocate the order toggle button to the control deck.
- Adjust styling to fit the navbar layout.

## Plan


## Verify Steps

- Confirm the order toggle appears left of Refresh Stream and still flips sorting.

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

Move the order toggle back to the filter grid in `.agent-plane/viewer/tasks.html`.

## Findings

No behavior changes beyond placement.

## Risks

Risk: layout crowding in the header on narrow widths; keep the button compact.
