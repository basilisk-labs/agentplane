## Summary

Migrate agent profiles to addressable prompt fragments

Convert bundled agent JSON profiles from bare string arrays to stable fragment objects with ids, text, and backward-compatible loading so recipes can patch individual agent workflow lines by fragment id.

## Scope

- In scope: Convert bundled agent JSON profiles from bare string arrays to stable fragment objects with ids, text, and backward-compatible loading so recipes can patch individual agent workflow lines by fragment id.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Migrate agent profiles to addressable prompt fragments".
