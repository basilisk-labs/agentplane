    Implement executable evaluator quality review

    Implement executable evaluator quality review
  Scope: |-
    - In scope: Implement executable evaluator quality review.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Implement executable evaluator quality review".
  Plan: |-
    1. Add an executable evaluator review command that writes prompt, report, and opinion artifacts under the task directory.
    2. Make task closure gates require a structured EVALUATOR quality report and non-empty pass findings instead of accepting bare pass notes.
    3. Update command catalog, generated CLI docs, user docs, and focused tests for the new review contract.
    4. Verify the command surface, quality gate behavior, docs freshness, policy routing, typecheck, and framework bootstrap.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run `bun run format:changed`. Expected: touched files are formatted.
    2. Run `bun test packages/agentplane/src/commands/evaluator/evaluator-run.command.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/commands/task/quality-review-gate.unit.test.ts`. Expected: evaluator run parsing and quality gate validation pass.
    3. Run `bun run typecheck`. Expected: TypeScript project build passes.
    4. Run `ap help evaluator run`. Expected: help lists the new executable evaluator review command and repeatable review fields; framework bootstrap succeeds if runtime is stale.
    5. Run `bun run docs:cli:check`. Expected: generated CLI reference is fresh.
    6. Run `node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs`. Expected: policy routing passes.
    7. Run `ap evaluator run 202605232011-MAW1PK --verdict pass --summary "..." --finding "..." --evidence <path-or-check> --json`. Expected: task quality_review is recorded by EVALUATOR with quality-report, prompt, and opinion artifact paths.
