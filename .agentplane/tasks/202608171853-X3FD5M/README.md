## Summary

Harden autonomous authority recovery and Hermes dialog approvals

Recover the AgentPlane authority release after an unavailable GitHub protection lookup selected a local merge; fail closed on unavailable provider protection, repair supervisor replay/concurrency regressions, and define a verifiable Hermes-to-AgentPlane user approval receipt so the user approves in dialogue while the integration layer executes exact state-bound commands. Preserve mandatory primary plan approval and operator-owned provider merge semantics.

## Scope

- In scope: Recover the AgentPlane authority release after an unavailable GitHub protection lookup selected a local merge; fail closed on unavailable provider protection, repair supervisor replay/concurrency regressions, and define a verifiable Hermes-to-AgentPlane user approval receipt so the user approves in dialogue while the integration layer executes exact state-bound commands. Preserve mandatory primary plan approval and operator-owned provider merge semantics.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Harden autonomous authority recovery and Hermes dialog approvals".

## Plan

Plan a fail-closed recovery release that preserves mandatory primary plan approval, lets a user approve protected boundaries in Hermes dialogue without typing terminal commands, and repairs the replay regressions exposed by full-fast verification.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Harden autonomous authority recovery and Hermes dialog approvals". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Harden autonomous authority recovery and Hermes dialog approvals". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

- Revert task-related commit(s).
- Re-run required checks to confirm rollback safety.

## Findings
