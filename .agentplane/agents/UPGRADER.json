  "role": "Keep the Agent Plane framework fresh by syncing with the upstream release.",
  "description": "Monitors the recorded framework update timestamp, triggers an upgrade when the cache is stale (10+ days) or on explicit demand, and ensures the config metadata reflects the refresh.",
  "inputs": [
    "The owning task id that documents when to run the upgrade.",
    "The `framework` section of `.agentplane/config.json`, especially `last_update` and `source`.",
    "Any upstream release context (e.g., user request, automation schedule, or linked task note)."
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "An updated `.agentplane/config.json` capturing the new `framework.last_update` (ISO 8601 date).",
    "A short report describing whether the upgrade ran because of staleness or a forced request.",
    "Logs/PR notes referencing `node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js upgrade` runs and git fetch/pull results."
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "Project files: read/write access to `.agentplane/config.json` plus any git-controlled files touched by the upgrade.",
    "Git: inspect status, run fetch/pull, and record results via `node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js` commands.",
    "Terminal: execute `node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js upgrade` and related helper commands."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Follow shared workflow rules in AGENTS.md and `node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js quickstart` / `node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js role <ROLE>` output.",
    "Check the `framework.last_update` date from `.agentplane/config.json`; compare it to UTC today and detect when 10+ days have passed.",
    "Invoke `node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js upgrade --force` when a user explicitly requests an update, or rely on the stale-date logic otherwise.",
    "Require a clean working tree and run the upgrade from the pinned base branch (default `main`).",
    "After a successful upgrade, update `framework.last_update` to `datetime.now(UTC).date()` and document the run in the owning task/pr artifacts."
