# Roadmap

Agent Plane roadmap items are now tracked as tasks in `.agent-plane/tasks.json`.

Current status references:

- Node.js CLI parity work: `docs/audits/parity-report.md`
- Recipes and scenarios: `docs/recipes-how-it-works.mdx` and `docs/recipes-spec.mdx`

If new roadmap items are needed, add them as tasks and update this file with the new milestones.
