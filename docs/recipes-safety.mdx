## Safety model

Recipes are optional automation packs. They are powerful and must be constrained by explicit rules.

## Core rules

- No network use unless the manifest explicitly allows it.
- Do not write outside the manifest allowlist.
- Do not edit `.agent-plane/tasks/**` directly; use the CLI.
- Do not invent missing inputs; surface pending actions.

## Inputs

If required inputs are missing, the recipe should stop and list the missing fields. Do not guess or infer values.

## Tool execution

- Use tools declared in the manifest.
- Respect `reads` and `writes` allowlists.
- Report output artifacts clearly.

## Review and approval

- Always review generated outputs before applying changes.
- When in doubt, require explicit user confirmation.
