## `agentplane` commands fail with E_USAGE

**Symptom:** CLI prints `E_USAGE` or "Usage: ..." errors.

**Fix:**

- Run `agentplane --help` to confirm the correct syntax.
- Check whether a subcommand is missing required flags.

## Task doc changes rejected

**Symptom:** Guardrails complain about missing doc metadata or manual edits.

**Fix:**

- Use `agentplane task doc set <task-id>` instead of editing README by hand.
- Ensure required sections exist (Summary, Scope, Risks, Verify Steps, Rollback Plan).

## Finish fails due to readiness

**Symptom:** `agentplane finish` complains about missing dependencies.

**Fix:**

- Use `agentplane task show <task-id>` to see dependencies.
- Finish dependencies first or use `--force` if you have explicit approval.

## Verify skipped unexpectedly

**Symptom:** `agentplane verify` does nothing.

**Fix:**

- Ensure the task has verify commands in its metadata.
- Use `--require` to fail if verify is missing.

## Branch/worktree errors

**Symptom:** branch_pr operations fail or worktree paths are rejected.

**Fix:**

- Ensure `workflow_mode` is `branch_pr`.
- In branch_pr, use `agentplane work start <task-id> ... --worktree` to create a valid worktree.
- Check that worktrees live under `.agentplane/worktrees`.

## Recipe fails due to missing inputs

**Symptom:** Recipe output shows "Pending Actions".

**Fix:**

- Provide the missing fields in the recipe inputs form or JSON.
- Re-run the scenario.

## Recipe blocked by safety rules

**Symptom:** Tool execution or file writes are denied.

**Fix:**

- Ensure the manifest allowlists the files you need to read/write.
- Ensure network access is allowed in the manifest if required.

## Sync fails for remote backend

**Symptom:** `agentplane sync` errors or reports network failures.

**Fix:**

- Confirm backend settings in `.agentplane/backends/<id>/backend.json`.
- Retry with `--direction pull` to refresh local cache.
- Check custom field mappings if using Redmine.
