## Agent

A role profile loaded from `.agentplane/agents/<ID>.json`.

## Task ID

A unique identifier like `202601031816-7F3K2Q` used to track work across backends.

## Primary tag

Exactly one policy-driving tag per task. The default allowlist is:
`code`, `data`, `research`, `docs`, `ops`, `product`, `meta`.

## Secondary tags

Additional tags used for search and scope hints. They do not relax policy rules.

## Workflow Artifact

Per-task documentation under `.agentplane/tasks/<task-id>/`.

## PR Artifact

Local PR simulation files under `.agentplane/tasks/<task-id>/pr/`.

## Worktree

A separate checkout used for task branches in `branch_pr` mode.

## workflow_mode

Config switch that chooses between `direct` and `branch_pr` workflows.

## Status commit

A commit that records major task state transitions. In current policy, this applies to transition points such as `doing -> blocked`, `doing -> done`, and `done -> verified`.

## Verify

Recording (and optionally executing) verification for a task.

- `agentplane verify ...` records a verification outcome in the task README (`## Verification`).
- In `branch_pr`, `agentplane integrate --run-verify` executes frontmatter `verify:` commands and appends output to `pr/verify.log`.

## Guard

Pre-commit checks that validate staged files and commit messages.

## Approval requirement

A policy gate that can require explicit approval for an action such as network access or `--force`, depending on config and execution profile.

## Backend

Pluggable task store that defines the canonical source of truth (local or redmine).

## Local Cache

The `.agentplane/tasks/` folder when backend=redmine; used for offline work and sync.

## Review report (`review.json`)

Structured output from `agentplane upgrade` that marks files requiring semantic merge review (`needsSemanticReview`).
