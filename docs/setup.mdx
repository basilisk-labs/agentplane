## Install (v1 target)

End users install and run the CLI as:

```bash
npx agentplane --help
# or
bun add -g agentplane
agentplane --help
```

## Initialize a project

Inside a git repository:

```bash
agentplane init
```

This creates `.agentplane/` (config, agents, tasks, caches). v1 is offline-first; network is used only by explicit commands.

During init, you choose minor approval toggles (plan approval and network access). The default agent remains ORCHESTRATOR and is not configured via init. Paths are backend-defined and not user-configurable during init.

## Upgrade a workspace

```bash
agentplane upgrade
```

Use this to refresh framework assets (recipes index, docs scaffolds, hooks).

## Developing inside this repo (current)

This repository contains the in-progress Node.js workspace under `packages/`. For local development:

```bash
bun install
bun run --filter=agentplane build
node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js --help
```

## Backend setup (when implemented)

- Configure the active backend in `.agentplane/config.json` (`tasks_backend.config_path`).
- Redmine credentials are loaded from `.env` without overriding already-set environment variables (see `redmine`).

## Optional recipes

Install optional recipes to enable extra workflows:

```bash
agentplane recipes install --name redmine
agentplane recipes install --name viewer
```

See `recipes-spec` for authoring or distributing recipes.
