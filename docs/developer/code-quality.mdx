title: "Code Quality Gates"
description: "The required quality checks for any change that touches packages/** in this repo."
---

This repository targets a high-signal, strict quality baseline for the Node.js/TypeScript codebase.

The rules below are **required** for any change that touches code under `packages/**`.

## Required gates (must pass)

Run with bun:

```bash
bun install
bun run format:check
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run coverage
```

`bun run ci` is the recommended single command.

## Scoped checks (faster dev loop)

When you only need to validate a specific package during development, use the scoped CI scripts:

```bash
bun run ci:agentplane
bun run ci:core
bun run ci:recipes
bun run ci:spec
bun run ci:testkit
```

These run Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, and tests only for the selected package. Full `bun run ci` is still required before merge/push.

## Enforcement

### Local (git hooks)

This repo installs `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks via `lefthook`. Hooks are a mandatory quality gate and must pass before commit or push:

```bash
pre-commit:
- bun run format:check
- bun run lint

pre-push:
- bun run ci
```

Hooks are installed automatically on `bun install` (via the root `postinstall` script). If you ever need to reinstall them:

```bash
bun run hooks:install
```

> Do not bypass hooks with `git commit --no-verify`. Fix the failures and rerun.

### CI (GitHub Actions)

GitHub Actions runs `bun run ci` on every pull request and on pushes to `main`.

## Tests

- Any new behavior MUST include tests.
- Bug fixes MUST include a regression test.
- Tests run via `vitest` and should live next to code: `packages/<pkg>/src/**/*.test.ts`.

## Coverage

- Coverage is enforced via `vitest` with minimum thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`.
- New code SHOULD increase or maintain overall coverage.

## Linting and formatting

- ESLint is required and enforced via `eslint.config.cjs`.
- Prettier is the single source of truth for formatting.
- Do not commit formatting-only diffs mixed with behavior changes unless necessary.

## Type safety

- `strict` TypeScript is required.
- Avoid `any`. If you must, document why and keep it local.
