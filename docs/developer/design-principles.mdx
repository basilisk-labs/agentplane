## Goals

Agent Plane is designed to make agent-driven development predictable and auditable. The system favors explicitness over convenience and makes workflow state visible and recoverable.

## Principles

### 1) Single source of truth

- Task state lives in `.agent-plane/tasks/`.
- Avoid manual edits; use the CLI for changes.

### 2) Explicit workflow transitions

- Start, block, verify, and finish are explicit operations.
- Status comments are structured and traceable.

### 3) Deterministic artifacts

- PR artifacts and task docs are structured and stable.
- Exports are reproducible from source data.

### 4) Minimal core, extensible edges

- Core provides task, workflow, and guardrails.
- Optional automation ships as recipes, not core behavior.

### 5) Offline-first by default

- No network use unless explicitly required.
- CLI should be safe to run locally without external dependencies.

### 6) Auditability

- Every task has a doc, verify steps, and rollback plan.
- Commits are tied to task IDs and include changelog detail.

## What this means for contributors

- Prefer explicit configs and clear CLI output over implicit behavior.
- Keep new functionality behind recipes when it is optional.
- Extend docs when new commands or flows are added.
