description: "How to contribute changes to Agent Plane."
---

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
bun run test:fast
```

## Workflow expectations

- Use `agentplane` CLI for task operations (no manual edits to tasks).
- Keep commits tied to a task ID.
- Follow the configured workflow mode (`direct` or `branch_pr`).
- For code changes, keep `dist/` in sync before commit when required by hooks.

## Where to change things

- CLI behavior: `packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.ts`
- Core logic: `packages/core/src/`
- Task backends: `packages/agentplane/src/backends/task-backend/`
- Documentation: `docs/`

## Testing

Run the CLI tests:

```bash
bun run test:cli
```

Run the faster CLI unit-ish suites (core + recipes):

```bash
bun run test:cli:unit
```

Run the CLI smoke test when validating full end-to-end behavior:

```bash
bun run test:cli:smoke
```

Run the slower CLI suites together (scenario + smoke):

```bash
bun run test:cli:slow
```

Run full checks when touching multiple areas:

```bash
bun run format:check
bun run schemas:check
bun run agents:check
bun run build
bun run lint
bun run test:full
```

## Documentation updates

- Keep docs in English.
- Update `docs/docs.json` when adding pages.
- Prefer clear, actionable examples.
- Keep docs changes in the same task that changes behavior.

## Submitting changes

- Ensure the working tree is clean except for intended changes.
- Provide a brief verification summary in task comments.
- Do not bypass hooks; fix failures locally before push.
