## Versioning

Use semantic versioning. The CLI depends on `@agentplane/core`, so bump versions together when APIs change.

## Build and pack

```bash
cd packages/agentplane
npm pack
```

Review the tarball contents before publishing.

## Publish order

If both packages are public, publish in this order:

```bash
cd packages/core
npm publish --access public

cd ../agentplane
npm publish --access public
```

## Trusted publishing (GitHub Actions)

To enable npm trusted publishing, configure the npm package to trust the GitHub Actions workflow
in this repository. Create a workflow named `publish.yml` under `.github/workflows/` and register
it in the npm “Trusted Publishers” settings for each package (`@agentplane/core` and `agentplane`).

Use GitHub-hosted runners and allow the workflow to request an OIDC token (`id-token: write`).
The workflow should publish from `packages/core` first, then `packages/agentplane`.

If you publish under the `@agentplane` scope, make sure the `agentplane` npm organization exists
and you have owner rights before publishing.

## Global install check

```bash
npm i -g agentplane@latest
agentplane --help
```

## Notes

- Ensure `dist/` is up to date before publishing.
- Keep metadata in `package.json` accurate (description, keywords, repository, etc.).
