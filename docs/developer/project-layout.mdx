## Overview

Agent Plane is a monorepo. The CLI is published as `agentplane`, and supporting packages live under `packages/`.

## Root folders

- `packages/agentplane/` — Node.js CLI entrypoint (TypeScript + ESM).
- `packages/core/` — core utilities (project resolution, config, task models).
- `packages/recipes/` — recipe runtime helpers (internal).
- Spec package — JSON schemas + examples for file formats.
- `packages/testkit/` — internal test helpers.
- `docs/` — developer documentation (Mintlify).
- `.agentplane/` — project state directory for the Node.js CLI.

## Generated artifacts

- `packages/**/dist/` — TypeScript build output (published in npm packages).
- `.agentplane/tasks/` — task READMEs (source of truth for tasks).
- `.agentplane/.runs/` — recipe run artifacts.

## Where to start
