## Why this page exists

This page defines where each topic lives, which code paths are the source of truth, and how to avoid duplicate or stale docs.

Use it as the routing table before editing any documentation page.

## Section boundaries

### User guide

Use `docs/user/*` for runtime behavior and operator workflows:

- How to initialize and run Agent Plane in a repository.
- What commands do in day-to-day use.
- How tasks, approvals, statuses, and backends behave from a user perspective.

### Developer guide

Use `docs/developer/*` for implementation and maintenance details:

- Package boundaries and architecture.
- CLI contracts, parser behavior, and tests.
- Release and publishing pipeline.
- Contribution standards and quality gates.

### Help

Use `docs/help/*` for diagnosis and recovery:

- Symptom-first troubleshooting.
- Common failure patterns and exact fixes.
- Shared terminology.

## Duplication rules

1. Put normative command syntax in command specs and generated CLI reference.
2. Keep narrative explanation in user/developer pages, but link to generated reference instead of copying long option lists.
3. Do not duplicate policy text between docs pages and `AGENTS.md`; summarize and link.
4. Treat release notes as historical records only, not as normative behavior docs.

## Update workflow

1. Find the owning page by using the mapping table above.
2. Confirm behavior in code before editing text.
3. Update navigation if a page is added, renamed, or removed:
   - `docs/index.mdx`
   - `docs/docs.json`
   - `docs/README.md`
4. If command output changed, regenerate `docs/user/cli-reference.generated.mdx`.
5. Run the docs task verification checklist before closing the task.

## Review checklist for this IA

- Every topic has exactly one primary owner page.
- Every owner page has a concrete code source path.
- Navigation and landing pages point to the same structure.
- No page claims behavior that is not present in code.
