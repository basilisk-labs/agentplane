## Recipe layout

Each recipe lives under `.agentplane/recipes/<slug>/` and includes:

- `manifest.json`
- `scenarios/*.md`
- `scenarios/*.inputs.json`
- `tools/` (optional)
- `README.md` (recommended)

## Manifest rules

- `schema_version` must be `recipe-manifest@1`.
- `slug` must match the folder name.
- `entrypoints` must include `ide` and/or `cli`.
- Each scenario must define `id`, `path`, and `inputs_schema`.

## Inventory refresh

Refresh the recipe index and review available entries:

```bash
agentplane recipes list-remote --refresh
agentplane recipes list
```

## Safety and I/O rules

- Do not write outside the manifest allowlist.
- Do not use network unless explicitly allowed in the manifest.
- Never edit `.agentplane/tasks/**` directly; use `agentplane` when required.

## Running a scenario

```bash
agentplane scenario run <recipe:scenario>
```

If the recipe includes tools, they run with inputs from the scenario form or JSON file.
