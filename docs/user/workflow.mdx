## Lifecycle

1. **Plan**: create tasks and dependencies.
2. **Start**: mark a task DOING with a structured comment.
3. **Verify**: run required checks.
4. **Finish**: mark DONE and attach commit metadata.

For the full end-to-end story (intake to export) across both modes, see [Task lifecycle](task-lifecycle).

## direct mode

- Work in a single checkout.
- Optional `agentplane work start` creates a task branch from the current HEAD (add `--worktree` for a worktree).

## branch_pr mode

- One task per branch/worktree.
- PR artifacts live under `.agentplane/tasks/<task-id>/pr/`.
- Integration requires PR checks and verify logs.

## Status transitions

```bash
agentplane start <task-id> --author CODER --body "Start: ..."
agentplane block <task-id> --author CODER --body "Blocked: ..."
agentplane finish <task-id> --author INTEGRATOR --body "Verified: ..."
```

## Commit guardrails

- Use `agentplane guard commit` to validate message and paths.
- Commit subjects must include the task ID suffix.

## Verification

```bash
agentplane verify <task-id>
```

Use `--skip-if-unchanged` to avoid re-running checks for the same commit.

## Spike tasks

Use tag `spike` to mark a research-only task (no schema changes required). A spike should end with:

- A clear decision and findings in the task README.
- Explicit exit criteria in `## Verify Steps`.
- One or more implementation tasks derived from the spike (typically `depends_on: [<spike-id>]`).
