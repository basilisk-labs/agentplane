title: "Agent discovery endpoints"
description: "Machine-oriented discovery files and indexable routes for agent and crawler workflows."
---

## Purpose

AgentPlane publishes machine-oriented discovery endpoints for LLM and agent-based crawlers.
These files summarize canonical routes and capability-focused pages without replacing core docs.

## Discovery files

1. `/llms.txt`
2. `/llms-full.txt`
3. `/robots.txt`
4. `/sitemap.xml`

## Canonical targets for discovery

1. [Overview](overview)
2. [Workflow](workflow)
3. [Commands](commands)
4. [Website information architecture](website-ia)
5. [Architecture](../developer/architecture)
6. [CLI contract](../developer/cli-contract)

## Maintenance rules

1. Keep discovery files aligned with docs routes after page moves or renames.
2. Do not publish stale links in `llms-full.txt`.
3. Treat these files as index aids, not as a second source of product truth.
