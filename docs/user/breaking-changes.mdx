## Summary

Agent Plane is now driven by the Node CLI `agentplane` with repository state under `.agentplane/`.

## Key changes

1. State directory is `.agentplane/`.
2. Initialization and upgrades are done through `agentplane init` and `agentplane upgrade`.
3. Task policy moved to primary-tag model:
   - `tasks.tags.primary_allowlist`
   - `tasks.verify.require_steps_for_primary`
   - `tasks.verify.require_verification_for_primary`
4. Comment-driven status commits are now limited to major transitions and use subject format:
   - `<emoji> <suffix> <primary>: <status>`
5. Redmine backend is env-first for credentials and field IDs.

## Migration checklist

1. Install/update CLI and run `agentplane init` in repo root.
2. Review `.agentplane/config.json` and move verify policy to primary-tag keys.
3. If using Redmine, populate `.env` from `.env.example` and verify custom field IDs.
4. Regenerate docs or scripts that relied on legacy commit subject assumptions.

## Notes

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical policy file for agent behavior in a repo; treat it as source-controlled infrastructure.
- `.agentplane/tasks.json` is an export-only snapshot generated via `agentplane task export`; do not edit it by hand.
