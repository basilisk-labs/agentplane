## Summary

Agent Plane 1.0 is Node-first. The CLI is `agentplane`, and the project state now lives under `.agentplane/`.

## Key changes

- **Project state directory**: 1.0 uses `.agentplane/` (no dash).
- **Primary CLI**: use `agentplane` (Node.js).
- **Init/upgrade flow**: initialize with `agentplane init` and update with `agentplane upgrade`.
- **Recipes**: optional features (e.g., `redmine`, `viewer`) are installed as recipes.

## Migration checklist

1. Install Node.js 20+ and the CLI (`npx agentplane` or `bun add -g agentplane`).
2. Run `agentplane init` in your repo to create `.agentplane/`.
3. Reinstall optional recipes as needed:
   - `agentplane recipes install --name redmine`
   - `agentplane recipes install --name viewer`

## Notes

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical policy file for agent behavior in a repo; treat it as source-controlled infrastructure.
- `.agentplane/tasks.json` is an export-only snapshot generated via `agentplane task export`; do not edit it by hand.
