## Summary

Agent Plane 1.0 is Node-first. The CLI is now `agentplane`, and the legacy Python helper is no longer required for day-to-day use.

## Key changes

- **Project state directory**: 1.0 uses `.agentplane/` (no dash). The legacy `.agent-plane/` layout is not supported by the Node CLI.
- **Primary CLI**: use `agentplane` (Node.js). The Python `agentctl.py` is legacy and kept only for framework maintenance.
- **Init/upgrade flow**: initialize with `agentplane init` and update with `agentplane upgrade`.
- **Recipes**: optional features (e.g., `redmine`, `viewer`) are installed as recipes.

## Migration checklist

1. Install Node.js 20+ and the CLI (`npx agentplane` or `bun add -g agentplane`).
2. Run `agentplane init` in your repo to create `.agentplane/`.
3. Reinstall optional recipes as needed:
   - `agentplane recipes install --name redmine`
   - `agentplane recipes install --name viewer`
4. If you used the legacy Python workflow, archive or remove `.agent-plane/` after migrating data.

## Notes

- The CLI does **not** auto-migrate legacy `.agent-plane/` data.
- `tasks.json` is managed by the Node CLI and includes a checksum; manual edits are discouraged.
