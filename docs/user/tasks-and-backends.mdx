## Task storage

Tasks are stored under `.agentplane/tasks/` as README files with frontmatter. Each task includes:

- Status, owner, priority, tags.
- Structured doc sections (Summary, Scope, Risks, Verify Steps, Rollback Plan).
- Append-only events for status changes, comments, and verification (when recorded by CLI).

See [Task lifecycle](task-lifecycle) for how these files are created and finalized.

## Task export

An export-only snapshot is written to `.agentplane/tasks.json` for integrations (gitignored by default).

```bash
agentplane task export
```

## Backends

The active backend is configured in `.agentplane/config.json`:

```json
{
  "tasks_backend": {
    "config_path": ".agentplane/backends/local/backend.json"
  }
}
```

- Local backend is the default (set during `agentplane init`).
- Remote backends require explicit configuration and sync.

## Sync

```bash
agentplane sync <backend> --direction pull
agentplane sync <backend> --direction push --yes
```

Conflict strategies: `diff`, `prefer-local`, `prefer-remote`, `fail`.

## Notes

- Treat `.agentplane/tasks.json` as a derived snapshot.
- Prefer `agentplane task doc set` for README updates.
