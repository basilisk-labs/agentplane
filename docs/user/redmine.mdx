## What this page covers

This page is the quick operational checklist.

For full contract details, required env keys, and backend JSON semantics, see [Redmine backend](backends/redmine).

## Quick start

1. Initialize with Redmine backend:

```bash
agentplane init --backend redmine
```

2. Fill `.env` from `.env.example`.

3. Confirm backend config path:

```bash
agentplane config show
```

4. Pull then push sync:

```bash
agentplane backend sync redmine --direction pull
agentplane backend sync redmine --direction push --yes
```

## Day-to-day sync pattern

- Pull before starting a task if remote state may have changed.
- Push after important updates and before final closure.
- Use `--conflict diff` first when diagnosing mismatches.

## Failure handling

- If connection fails, verify URL/API key/project env values first.
- If writes fail, check custom field IDs in env.
- If sync output looks stale, run pull and then inspect local task README metadata.
