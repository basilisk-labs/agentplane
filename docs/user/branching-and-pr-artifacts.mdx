## workflow_mode

Configured in `.agentplane/config.json`.

### direct

- Single-checkout workflow.
- Task branches and PR artifacts are optional.
- Tasks can be implemented and closed on the current branch.
- `agentplane work start` records the active task (single-stream) for the current checkout in direct mode.

### branch_pr

- Task branches and worktrees are required.
- `agentplane work start` must run on base branch and must include `--worktree`.
- Canonical task writes happen only on base branch.
- INTEGRATOR performs verify, merge, and finish.

## Task Branches and Worktrees

- Branch naming: `task/<task-id>/<slug>` by default (config: `branch.task_prefix`).
- Worktrees live under `.agentplane/worktrees/` by default (config: `paths.worktrees_dir`).

## PR Artifacts

- Location: `.agentplane/tasks/<task-id>/pr/`.
- Files: `meta.json`, `diffstat.txt`, `verify.log`, `review.md`.
- Purpose: local PR simulation for review and integration.

## Handoff Notes

- Reviewers and executors record handoff notes in `review.md`.
- INTEGRATOR appends notes into the task closure record.

## Commands

See [`cli-contract`](../developer/cli-contract) for the authoritative command surface.

Typical branch_pr flow:

```bash
agentplane work start <task-id> --agent CODER --slug <slug> --worktree
agentplane pr open <task-id> --branch task/<task-id>/<slug> --author CODER
agentplane pr update <task-id>
agentplane pr check <task-id>
agentplane integrate <task-id> --run-verify
agentplane finish <task-id> --author INTEGRATOR --body "Verified: ..." --result "<one line>"
```
