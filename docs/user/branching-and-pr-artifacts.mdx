## workflow_mode

Configured in `.agentplane/config.json`.

### direct

- Single-checkout workflow.
- Task branches and PR artifacts are optional.
- Tasks can be implemented and closed on the current branch.

### branch_pr

- Task branches and worktrees are required.
- Canonical task writes happen only on the base branch.
- INTEGRATOR performs verify, merge, and finish.

## Task Branches and Worktrees

- Branch naming: `task/<task-id>/<slug>` by default (config: `branch.task_prefix`).
- Worktrees live under `.agentplane/worktrees/` by default (config: `paths.worktrees_dir`).

## PR Artifacts

- Location: `.agentplane/tasks/<task-id>/pr/`.
- Files: `meta.json`, `diffstat.txt`, `verify.log`, `review.md`.
- Purpose: local PR simulation for review and integration.

## Handoff Notes

- Reviewers and executors record handoff notes in `review.md`.
- INTEGRATOR appends notes into the task closure record.

## Commands

See [`cli-contract`](../developer/cli-contract) for the authoritative command surface. The 1.0 workflow uses:

- `agentplane work start` (create task branch + worktree)
- `agentplane pr open|update|check|note`
- `agentplane integrate` (branch_pr integration)

## Legacy note

The legacy Python toolchain uses `.agent-plane/` paths; the 1.0 target uses `.agentplane/`.
