## Scope

This checklist covers production indexing for `agentplane.org` after website deployment.

## DNS and HTTPS prechecks

1. Ensure apex and `www` records point to GitHub Pages targets.
2. Keep Cloudflare records in DNS-only mode for GitHub Pages endpoints.
3. Confirm GitHub Pages custom domain is set to `agentplane.org`.
4. Enable HTTPS enforcement in GitHub Pages after certificate issuance.

## Search Console (Google)

1. Add `agentplane.org` as **Domain property**.
2. Verify ownership using Cloudflare DNS TXT record.
3. Submit sitemap: `https://agentplane.org/sitemap.xml`.
4. Request indexing for:
   - `/`
   - `/docs`
   - `/blog`
5. Monitor coverage and enhancement reports weekly after launch.

## Bing Webmaster

1. Add site in Bing Webmaster Tools.
2. Verify ownership (DNS TXT or Search Console import).
3. Submit sitemap: `https://agentplane.org/sitemap.xml`.

## Analytics activation

1. Create GTM web container and GA4 property.
2. Set environment variables for website runtime:
   - `GTM_CONTAINER_ID`
   - `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
3. Rebuild and redeploy website.
4. Validate events in GA4 DebugView:
   - page views (`/`, `/docs/*`, `/blog/*`)
   - outbound clicks to GitHub/docs CTAs.

## Crawler endpoints validation

Validate the following are reachable on production:

1. `/robots.txt`
2. `/sitemap.xml`
3. `/llms.txt`
4. `/llms-full.txt`

## Post-release monitoring

1. Check indexed page growth in Search Console.
2. Inspect top queries and CTR for docs/blog pages.
3. Track broken links via docs CI and resolve in next patch.
