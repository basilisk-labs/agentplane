## What Agent Plane is

Agent Plane is a local CLI workflow for agent-driven development in a git repository.

You run `agentplane` once to initialize a repo, then agents use the same CLI for planning, execution, verification, and closure.

## What it gives you

- A policy file in repo root: `AGENTS.md`.
- A repo-local workspace in `.agentplane/`.
- Task tracking with explicit ownership and dependencies.
- Guarded commit and finish flows.
- Optional backends, including local and Redmine.

## What it does not do

- It is not a hosted service. There is no remote runtime.
- It is not a replacement for your editor. It sits on top of your existing IDE and terminal.
- It does not hide git. You still see and control commit history.

## How the pieces fit

1. `agentplane init` creates `AGENTS.md`, `.agentplane/config.json`, backend stubs, and agent templates.
2. Agents create and run tasks through `agentplane task/start/verify/finish`.
3. Policy and approvals are enforced from config plus `AGENTS.md`.
4. Task artifacts and metadata stay inside the repository.

## Source of truth model

- Workflow policy: `AGENTS.md`.
- CLI behavior: command specs and runtime code.
- Config schema/defaults: `packages/spec/schemas/config.schema.json`.
- Current repo config: `.agentplane/config.json`.
