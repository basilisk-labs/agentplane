## What Agent Plane Is

Agent Plane is a local, repo-scoped workflow framework for using OpenAI Codex in your IDE. The current Node.js 1.0 deliverable is a globally installable CLI named `agentplane` that provides:

- JSON-defined agents
- a task system with pluggable backends
- workflow guardrails and commit rules so work stays planned, traceable, and reviewable

## What Agent Plane Is Not

- Not a remote service or runner. Everything happens inside your local repo.
- Not an auto-commit bot. You stay in control of commands and commits.
- Not a replacement for your IDE. It is a workflow layer on top of it.

## Core Principles

- Local-first: no external runtime or daemon is required.
- Backend-driven truth: the canonical task source depends on the active backend.
- Traceability: every task ties back to a stable ID and a commit.
- Role clarity: each agent has a defined scope and permissions.
- Explicit approvals: plan and network approvals are controlled via config (`agents.approvals.*`); closure approvals follow `closure_commit_requires_approval`.

## Core Components

- Global policy document that defines roles, approvals, and workflow guardrails.
- `.agentplane/`: project state directory created by `agentplane init` (config, tasks, caches, recipes).
- `agentplane`: the Node.js CLI users run (`npx agentplane …` or `bun add -g agentplane`).
- [`cli-contract`](../developer/cli-contract): the authoritative 1.0 command surface.
- Schemas and examples for config, task exports, and PR metadata.

## Where to Start

- Start with [Prerequisites](prerequisites) and [Setup](setup).
- For commands, follow [`cli-contract`](../developer/cli-contract).

## Planned Expansions

- Add a visual summary of backend flow (local vs redmine) and canonical source switching.
- Include a primer on the task ID format (`YYYYMMDDHHMM-<RAND>`).
