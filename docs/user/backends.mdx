## Overview

A backend defines task storage and sync behavior.

`agentplane` resolves backend config from `.agentplane/config.json` and routes task commands through that backend.

## Available backends

- [Local backend](./backends/local)
- [Redmine backend](./backends/redmine)

## Remote backends

Remote backends are optional and must be configured explicitly.

## Sync model

Use explicit sync commands:

```bash
agentplane backend sync <id> --direction pull
agentplane backend sync <id> --direction push --yes
```

The CLI may maintain a local cache and falls back to it when remote services are unavailable.

Prefer `agentplane backend sync` in docs and automation.

## Conflict strategies

- `diff` — report differences without overwriting.
- `prefer-local` — local state wins.
- `prefer-remote` — remote state wins.
- `fail` — abort when conflicts exist.

## Backend configuration

Backend config path lives in `.agentplane/config.json` at `tasks_backend.config_path`.

### Backend config format (standardized)

Each backend config uses this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "local",
  "version": 1,
  "settings": {
    "dir": ".agentplane/tasks"
  }
}
```

Legacy fields like `module`/`class` are ignored by the loader.
