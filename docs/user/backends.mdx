## Overview

A backend defines where tasks are stored and how synchronization happens. Backends are first-class CLI features (not recipes). The CLI loads the configured backend from `.agentplane/config.json` and routes all task commands through it.

## Available backends

- [Local backend](./backends/local)
- [Redmine backend](./backends/redmine)

## Remote backends

Remote backends (for example Redmine) are optional and should be configured explicitly. They typically include:

- Connection settings (URL, API key, project).
- Custom field mappings for task metadata.
- Sync direction and conflict policy.

## Sync model

Use explicit sync commands:

```bash
agentplane sync <backend> --direction pull
agentplane sync <backend> --direction push --yes
```

The CLI may maintain a local cache and falls back to it when remote services are unavailable.

## Conflict strategies

- `diff` — report differences without overwriting.
- `prefer-local` — local state wins.
- `prefer-remote` — remote state wins.
- `fail` — abort when conflicts exist.

## Backend configuration

Backend config file path is stored in `.agentplane/config.json` under `tasks_backend.config_path`. During init you can choose `--backend local|redmine`, and you can switch later by updating this path.

### Backend config format (standardized)

Each backend config is a JSON file with a stable shape:

```json
{
  "id": "local",
  "version": 1,
  "settings": {
    "dir": ".agentplane/tasks"
  }
}
```

Legacy fields like `module`/`class` are ignored by the loader.

Example:

```json
{
  "tasks_backend": {
    "config_path": ".agentplane/backends/local/backend.json"
  }
}
```

## Adding a backend

- Implement the backend interface in the CLI.
- Provide a config template under `.agentplane/backends/<id>/`.
- Document required fields and safety caveats.
