title: "Website information architecture"
description: "Canonical section model for the public website, docs navigation, and blog discovery flow."

## Purpose

This page defines the public website structure used by the Docusaurus deployment on `agentplane.org`.
It keeps marketing, technical docs, and blog content aligned to one routing model.

## Top-level routes

1. `/` — product narrative and conversion entry point.
2. `/docs` — canonical documentation sourced from repository `docs/`.
3. `/blog` — editorial stream for releases, implementation notes, and migration guides.

## Home page section contract

The home page must map each section to concrete docs pages:

1. **Getting Started**
   Links: `docs/user/overview`, `docs/user/prerequisites`, `docs/user/setup`.
2. **Workflow Model**
   Links: `docs/user/workflow`, `docs/user/task-lifecycle`, `docs/user/agents`.
3. **Reference**
   Links: `docs/user/commands`, `docs/user/configuration`, `docs/reference/generated-reference`.
4. **Developer Track**
   Links: `docs/developer/architecture`, `docs/developer/cli-contract`, `docs/developer/release-and-publishing`.
5. **Support**
   Links: `docs/help/troubleshooting-by-symptom`, `docs/help/glossary`.

## Blog scope

Blog posts should be limited to:

1. Release announcements with migration notes.
2. Workflow deep dives and architecture rationale.
3. Operational guidance for CI, policy, and verification changes.

Posts must link back to canonical docs pages and avoid duplicating full reference material.

## SEO and discovery requirements

1. Every top-level section must have stable title and meta description.
2. Home page claims must link to verifiable docs artifacts.
3. Blog posts must include author, date, tags, and canonical URL.
4. Search and crawler endpoints (`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`) must be kept in the deploy artifact.
