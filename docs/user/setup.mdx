---

## Install (Node.js 1.0)

End users install and run the CLI as:

```bash
npx agentplane --help
# or
bun add -g agentplane
agentplane --help
```

## Initialize a project

Inside a git repository (or a new folder):

```bash
agentplane init
```

This creates `.agentplane/` (config, agents, tasks, caches). 1.0 is offline-first; network is used only by explicit commands.
If the folder is not a git repository, init will create one, pin the base branch, and commit the install.
If the folder is already a git repository, init pins the base branch to the current branch and commits the install artifacts.

During init, you choose approval toggles and the task backend. Use `--backend local` (default) or `--backend redmine`. The default IDE mode is Codex CLI; pass `--ide cursor` or `--ide windsurf` to install only that IDE’s rules file. The default agent remains ORCHESTRATOR and is not configured via init. You can switch backends later by updating `tasks_backend.config_path` in `.agentplane/config.json`.

## Upgrade a workspace

```bash
agentplane upgrade
```

Use this to refresh framework assets (recipes index, docs scaffolds, hooks).

## Developing inside this repo (current)

This repository contains the in-progress Node.js workspace under `packages/`. For local development:

```bash
bun install
bun run --filter=@agentplaneorg/core build
bun run --filter=agentplane build
node packages/agentplane/bin/agentplane.js --help
```

## Backend setup (when implemented)

- Configure the active backend in `.agentplane/config.json` (`tasks_backend.config_path`).
- Redmine credentials are loaded from `.env` without overriding already-set environment variables (see `redmine`).

## Optional recipes

Install optional recipes to enable extra workflows unrelated to core backends:

```bash
agentplane recipes install --name viewer
```

See `recipes-spec` for authoring or distributing recipes.
