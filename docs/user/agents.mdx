## Source of truth and precedence

Agent behavior is resolved in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `agentplane quickstart` and `agentplane role <ROLE>`
3. `.agentplane/config.json`
4. `.agentplane/agents/*.json`

Profiles live under `.agentplane/agents/*.json`, but they cannot override higher-level policy.

## ORCHESTRATOR

- Starts every run.
- Translates a goal into a plan and requests approval.
- Creates no non-executable tasks.

## PLANNER

- Owns executable task creation and dependency graph updates.
- For a single work item, creates exactly one task.
- Reuses matching open tasks when scope and owner align.
- Splits tasks only at real ownership/dependency boundaries.
- Assigns owners from existing agent IDs.
- If a role is missing, creates a CREATOR task first.

## CODER

- Implements changes with tight diffs.
- Executes required checks and records concrete outcomes.

## TESTER

- Verifies behavior and regression safety.
- Prioritizes reproducible checks and failure diagnostics.

## DOCS

- Updates user-facing documentation and task artifacts.
- Keeps docs aligned with runtime behavior and CLI output.

## REVIEWER

- Reviews risk, regressions, and policy compliance.
- Records findings with severity and exact file references.

## INTEGRATOR

- Required closer in `branch_pr`.
- Integrates task branches and performs final finish/export on base branch.

## CREATOR

- CREATOR adds new agents when no existing role fits the need.

## UPGRADER

- Handles semantic merge conflicts after `agentplane upgrade` when review artifacts require it.
- Reconciles `AGENTS.md` and agent profiles without breaking policy precedence.

## REDMINE

- Backend-aware executor that interacts with Redmine tasks only via `agentplane` flows.
- Uses env-first backend configuration and respects configured custom field mappings.

## Notes

- Role command guidance is available via `agentplane role <ROLE>`.
- For policy details, read `AGENTS.md`.
