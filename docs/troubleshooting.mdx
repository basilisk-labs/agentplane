## tasks.json mismatch or stale data

- Cause: `tasks.json` is an exported view and may be stale.
- Fix: re-run `agentplane task export` (writes `.agentplane/tasks.json`).

## Dirty working tree before commit

- Cause: unrelated edits or forgotten files.
- Fix: `git status --short`, then stash or commit only what belongs to the task.

## Outdated task state

- Cause: viewing stale data from cache or a previous export.
- Fix: re-run `agentplane task list` or `agentplane task show`, then sync if needed.

## Redmine unreachable

- Cause: network outage or API credentials expired.
- Fix: keep working against the offline cache (when configured), then run `agentplane backend sync redmine` once connectivity returns.

## Redmine sync conflicts

- Cause: local cache diverged from Redmine.
- Fix: re-run sync and choose a conflict strategy (`--conflict diff|prefer-local|prefer-remote|fail`) after reviewing the diff.

## agentplane command failures

- Cause: running outside a git repo, or missing Node.js 20+.
- Fix: run inside a git repository (or pass `--root <path>`) and ensure Node.js 20+ is available.

## IDE or plugin stops responding

- Fix: restart the IDE or reload the project, then re-run the last command manually.
