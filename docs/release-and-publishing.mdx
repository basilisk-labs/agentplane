## Versioning

Use semantic versioning. The CLI depends on `@agentplane/core`, so bump versions together when APIs change.

## Build and pack

```bash
cd packages/agentplane
npm pack
```

Review the tarball contents before publishing.

## Publish order

If both packages are public, publish in this order:

```bash
cd packages/core
npm publish --access public

cd ../agentplane
npm publish --access public
```

## Global install check

```bash
npm i -g agentplane@latest
agentplane --help
```

## Notes

- Ensure `dist/` is up to date before publishing.
- Keep metadata in `package.json` accurate (description, keywords, repository, etc.).
