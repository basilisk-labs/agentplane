# Release Notes - v0.2.21

- Added a repository-context warning when `agentplane` is invoked from a global installation inside the framework checkout, reducing version-mismatch confusion during local development.
- Added a stable `test:guard` root script so guard coverage can be run with one deterministic command instead of brittle glob patterns.
- Added a generated CLI reference freshness gate (`docs:cli:check`) and wired it into both CI and publish workflows, preventing stale `docs/user/cli-reference.generated.mdx` from reaching releases.
- Added post-publish npm smoke verification in the publish workflow to confirm that `@agentplaneorg/core` and `agentplane` are visible in the registry after publication.
- Updated generated CLI reference output to match the current command surface and keep docs aligned with shipped behavior.
