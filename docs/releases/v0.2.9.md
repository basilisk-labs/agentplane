# Release Notes — v0.2.9

- Fix `recipes install` validation for unsafe `.tar.gz` archives on GNU tar: warnings no longer surface as I/O failures, and unsafe entries are consistently rejected as validation errors.
- Improve release automation robustness for bun-based workspaces: `release apply` keeps `bun.lock` in sync so CI `bun install --frozen-lockfile` succeeds.
- Strengthen end-to-end publish reliability by ensuring the tag commit passes the full CLI test suite in Linux CI.
