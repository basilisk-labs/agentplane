# Release Notes — v0.1.7

- Refactored the largest CLI workflow modules into domain and per-command files to reduce review scope and make maintenance easier (no intended behavior changes).
- Split the massive core CLI test suite into scenario-focused files to improve navigation and reduce triage time when failures happen.
- Stabilized task lifecycle metadata handling and exports in the branching workflow, with additional guardrails around export-only snapshots.
