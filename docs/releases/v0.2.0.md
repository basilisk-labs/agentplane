# Release Notes — v0.2.0

- Clarified policy contracts: downstream tasks must be owned by an execution agent from `.agentplane/agents`, with a CREATOR fallback when a suitable agent is missing.
- Improved CLI ergonomics: added `--json-errors` for unambiguous machine-readable error output (kept `--json` as a backwards-compatible alias in the scoped-global zone).
- Better reliability and auditability: expanded unit coverage for task lifecycle commands and added warnings when task owners do not match the local agent registry.
