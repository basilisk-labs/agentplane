# Release Notes — v0.2.2

- Fix: `agentplane upgrade` no longer fails when GitHub releases do not include the upgrade bundle assets; it falls back to the release `tarball_url`.
- Safety: in `tarball_url` fallback mode, upgrade only applies `AGENTS.md` and `.agentplane/*` (ignoring all other repo files), and still blocks any `.git` paths.
- Quality: added unit coverage for asset vs tarball download resolution to prevent regressions.
