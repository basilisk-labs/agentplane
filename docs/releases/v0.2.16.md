# Release Notes - v0.2.16

- Fixed a CI lint regression introduced in the Redmine env-template generator by switching to immutable array construction in `init` internals.
- Stabilized the release pipeline after the previous failed publish attempt: this patch is focused on restoring fully green `publish.yml` execution.
- No workflow contract changes for users: Redmine remains env-first, secrets stay out of backend JSON, and `.env` stays protected by init-managed `.gitignore` rules.
