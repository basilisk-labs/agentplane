# Release Notes — v0.2.8

- Fix the release workflow so GitHub publish jobs using `bun install --frozen-lockfile` do not fail after version bumps.
- `agentplane release apply` now regenerates and stages `bun.lock` when present, keeping lockfile state consistent with bumped workspace versions.
- Improve reliability of automated patch releases by making the release commit self-contained (versions, notes, and lockfile updates).
