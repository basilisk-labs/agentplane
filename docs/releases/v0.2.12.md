# Release Notes — v0.2.12

- Republish the current stable code as a new patch after `agentplane@0.2.11` was yanked from npm; use `0.2.12` instead of `0.2.11`.
- No functional changes relative to `v0.2.11`; this release exists to restore a clean, strictly monotonic patch-release pipeline.
- If you pinned `agentplane@0.2.11`, update to `agentplane@0.2.12` (and keep `@agentplaneorg/core` aligned) to ensure installs work via the public registry.
