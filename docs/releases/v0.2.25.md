# Release Notes — v0.2.25

- Enforced explicit commit allowlists across commit-capable commands; automatic allowlist derivation is now disabled.
- Added safety guardrails that reject repo-wide allowlist prefixes (`.`) to prevent accidental broad staging.
- Improved CLI guidance and troubleshooting with actionable allowlist hints, including `agentplane guard suggest-allow --format args`.
- Updated generated CLI reference documentation to reflect the new commit/allowlist contract.
