# Release Notes - v0.2.15

- `agentplane init --backend redmine` now uses an env-first setup: it creates a managed `.env` template block with required Redmine variables and keeps existing values untouched.
- Redmine credentials are no longer written into `.agentplane/backends/redmine/backend.json`; backend config now focuses on non-secret behavior and mapping settings.
- Runtime validation for Redmine is clearer and stricter: missing required `AGENTPLANE_REDMINE_*` variables now produce explicit, actionable errors.
- Init safety improved for secret hygiene: `.env` is now always added to the init-managed `.gitignore` runtime block.
- The Redmine env-first flow is covered by updated CLI and backend regression tests, and user documentation has been aligned with the new contract.
