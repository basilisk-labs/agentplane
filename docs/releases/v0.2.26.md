# Release Notes — v0.2.26

- Enforced explicit commit allowlists across commit-capable commands and removed auto-allow fallback paths, so agents only commit intentionally scoped files.
- Added a guardrail that rejects repo-wide allowlist prefixes (`.`) to prevent accidental broad staging in task/status/finish commit flows.
- Improved agent-facing CLI guidance for allowlist errors, including direct hints to use `agentplane guard suggest-allow --format args`.
- Updated command and troubleshooting docs to reflect the explicit allowlist contract and common failure recovery steps.
- Added a dedicated pre-publish workflow with an Ubuntu + Windows matrix and connected publish gating so release pipelines verify cross-platform behavior before npm publish.
- Added a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow lint check (`actionlint`) and centralized framework path filters to reduce CI/prepublish drift.
