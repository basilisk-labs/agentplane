# Release Notes — v0.3.0

- Direct mode is now single-stream: `agentplane work start` no longer creates per-task branches and instead records an active-task lock to prevent accidental parallel task work in one checkout.
- Help and workflow guidance were updated to match the direct-mode behavior change, with CLI tests/snapshots adjusted to prevent docs/help drift.
- Local branch clutter is reduced by design in direct mode (no more `task/<id>/<slug>` branch creation), making repo histories simpler for teams that run in one flow on `main`.
