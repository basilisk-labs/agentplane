# Release Notes — v0.3.0

- Safety: `agentplane upgrade` now applies a strict manifest of framework-managed files only (no directory scanning), and it never writes user-owned paths like `.agentplane/tasks/**`.
- UX: upgrade defaults to the locally installed agentplane package assets (no network). GitHub release upgrades are now explicit via `--remote`.
- Reliability: upgrade maintains `.agentplane/.upgrade/` state with `lock.json`, `state.json`, and baselines for deterministic merges.
