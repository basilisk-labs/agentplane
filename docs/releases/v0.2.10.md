# Release Notes — v0.2.10

- Fix cross-platform recipe archive validation for `.tar.gz` by parsing tar headers in-process (no dependency on system `tar` behavior or exit codes).
- `recipes install` now rejects unsafe tar entries consistently as validation errors, matching CI expectations and preventing publish-time test failures.
- Improve release pipeline stability by removing a Linux-only flake in the full CLI test suite.
