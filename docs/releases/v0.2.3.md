# Release Notes — v0.2.3

- Fix: `agentplane upgrade` tarball fallback no longer fails on slower networks due to an overly aggressive 1.5s download timeout.
- Reliability: `downloadToFile` now uses a more realistic default timeout for downloads, reducing flakiness in recipe installs and upgrades.
- Safety: upgrade tarball fallback remains allowlist-scoped to `AGENTS.md` and `.agentplane/*`.
