# Release Notes — v0.1.4

- Release publishing is more reliable: the publish workflow now triggers on tag create/push and validates release notes before publishing.
- Release notes are now required and standardized with a template, keeping releases human-readable and consistent.
- Task docs and package READMEs are cleaner and more user-friendly, reducing duplication and clarifying guidance.
