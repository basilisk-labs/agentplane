# Release Notes — v0.2.7

- Add an agent-assisted release workflow: `agentplane release plan` emits a structured changes list and a target version/tag for release notes authoring.
- Add `agentplane release apply` to validate release notes, bump package versions, create a release commit, and tag `vX.Y.Z` for the publish workflow.
- Improve CI reliability for coverage-heavy runs to reduce flakiness and timeouts.
- Ignore `.agentplane/.release` artifacts in git status to keep working trees clean during release planning.
