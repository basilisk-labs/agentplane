# Release Notes: v0.2.18

- Hardened approval typing in CLI update-check and shared approval requirement paths to keep release-time lint/build deterministic.
- Strengthened release quality gates so local prepublish runs align with CI, including schema/agent sync checks, coverage guardrails, and fast+critical test suites.
- Expanded doctor and guard reliability checks around DONE task commit invariants, close-message generation, and hook-safe workflows.
- Improved upgrade and init robustness with cleaner transient artifact handling, better Redmine env contract support, and execution-profile approval escalation consistency.
