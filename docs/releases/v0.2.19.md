# Release Notes: v0.2.19

- Enforced GitHub-only npm publishing by adding a prepublish guard that blocks local `npm publish` and directs releases to the GitHub `Publish to npm` workflow.
- Enforced provenance at package level by setting `publishConfig.provenance=true` for both `@agentplaneorg/core` and `agentplane`.
- Hardened `agentplane release apply --push` to require a successful local `bun run release:prepublish` gate before pushing release commit and tag.
- Improved publish workflow resilience by keeping idempotent npm publish behavior for already-published versions during reruns.
