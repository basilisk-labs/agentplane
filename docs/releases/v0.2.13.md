# Release Notes — v0.2.13

- Added a required local pre-release gate (`bun run release:ci-check`) that mirrors the core GitHub CI checks (build, lint, fast tests, critical CLI tests) before versioning and publish.
- Improved workspace initialization hygiene by adding runtime `.agentplane` paths to generated `.gitignore`, reducing accidental commits of cache and operation artifacts.
- Tightened CLI and process consistency around JSON error flag behavior, role/profile guidance, and documentation alignment so local guidance matches actual command behavior.
- Strengthened upgrade and maintenance reliability with cleanup of transient upgrade artifacts and improved semantic-review/doctor workflow coverage in tests.
