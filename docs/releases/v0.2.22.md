# Release Notes - v0.2.22

- Improved CLI lifecycle ergonomics by keeping `task start-ready` output aligned with the single-command readiness/start contract used in tests and automation.
- Added stronger release preparation flow through `release plan` + validated notes input, keeping patch version bumps deterministic and traceable.
- Preserved guardrail behavior for task lifecycle commands so commit/verify transitions remain constrained to major status moves and avoid duplicate lifecycle actions.
