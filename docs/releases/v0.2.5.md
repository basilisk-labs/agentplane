# Release Notes — v0.2.5

- Direct mode is now single-stream: `agentplane work start` no longer creates per-task branches and instead records an active-task lock to prevent accidental parallel task work in one checkout.
- `agentplane task finish` clears the direct-mode active-task lock (best-effort), reducing “stuck” work states.
- Help and workflow guidance were updated to match the direct-mode behavior change, with CLI tests/snapshots updated to prevent help drift.
