# Release Notes — v0.2.6

- Enforced a consistent, emoji-based commit subject policy with clearer, actionable error messages.
- Added executor-agent emoji support for agentplane-generated status/comment-driven commits, including strict `✅` enforcement for DONE/finish commits.
- Improved dev-repo ergonomics by ignoring test-only changes when checking whether `dist/` is stale (reduces false blocks during normal commits).
