# Release Notes — v0.2.24

- Added stronger cross-platform CI checks, including Windows-focused coverage in release-related validation paths.
- Improved local hook reliability on Windows with PATH fallback behavior and clearer recovery guidance when tool resolution fails.
- Updated generated CLI reference docs and synchronized agent templates with the currently active agent profile set.
- Improved `init` onboarding by replacing setup profiles with persona-based setup flow.
- Tightened task creation behavior by enforcing stricter task graph/ownership rules and auto-scaffolding task docs on creation.
- Relaxed release-notes generation constraints by removing the previous fixed three-bullet expectation.
