# Release Notes — v0.2.17

- Hardened release safety checks in `agentplane release apply`: the command now fails early on a dirty tracked working tree and on an already-existing target tag, reducing partial-release mistakes.
- Added deterministic pre-publish validation for npm version availability so publish flows catch "version already published" conditions before pushing release state.
- Improved release pipeline reliability with explicit publish-workflow validation and updated release documentation for the new guardrails and expected operator flow.
- Fixed `init` commit ordering so hook shim files are included in the install commit, plus regression coverage to ensure `init` leaves a clean tracked tree.
