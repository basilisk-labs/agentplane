# Release Notes — v0.2.14

- Added configurable execution profiles (`conservative`, `balanced`, `aggressive`) in `.agentplane/config.json`, including reasoning effort, tool budgets, and explicit unsafe-action confirmation controls.
- Upgraded `agentplane init` into a clearer human-first onboarding flow with grouped prompts, visual sections, and explicit profile/safety selection during setup.
- Enforced conservative-mode runtime safety for forced status transitions: `--force` is now blocked by default unless an explicit override is provided.
- Updated user-facing documentation and generated CLI reference to reflect the new init flow and execution profile flags.
- Revalidated the release candidate with the same local CI-equivalent gate used in GitHub (`build`, `lint`, `test:fast`, and `test:critical`).
