# Release Notes — v0.1.5

- CLI contract and error handling are stabilized (exit codes aligned; JSON error schema fixed).
- Update checks are now cached offline-first and respect ETag to avoid network hits on every run.
- Safer archive handling (validation + zip slip protection, including yauzl-based zip checks).
- CLI refactor: shared utilities and modular command namespaces (recipes/upgrade/task/workflow).
- Task workflow improvements: schema-driven config validation, Verify Steps execution, Verification section updates, and verify approval support.
- Task performance improvements via local task index cache and faster list/search.
- Backend architecture updates: init-time backend selection, standardized backend config, and expanded local/Redmine documentation.
- Supply-chain hardening: signed recipes index verification and scenario audit reporting.
- Reliability updates: atomic writes for critical files and version sourced from package.json.
