# Release Notes — v0.1.3

- Task docs are cleaner and more predictable: duplicate section headers are removed and edits now merge into existing sections instead of creating new ones.
- `doc_updated_by` now reflects the actual last commenter, so ownership history is clearer and more useful.
- CLI UX is improved with startup update checks and a more reliable base-branch selection flow in `branch_pr` setups.
- Package docs are stronger: npm README content is tightened, trusted publishing requirements are documented, and hooks are treated as a mandatory quality gate.
- Release pipeline hardening continued (npm auth/config edge cases handled more robustly).
