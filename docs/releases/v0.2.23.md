# Release Notes - v0.2.23

- Added Windows-friendly release checks by switching release:check to a Node-based script that sets NPM_CONFIG_CACHE explicitly, avoiding shell cd chains and fragile ~/.npm cache behavior.
- Added release regression coverage for both core and agentplane dry-run packs with explicit cache and working-directory checks.
- Added local cache policy in release validation and documented repository artifacts language defaults in AGENTS policy.
