# Release Notes — v0.2.1

- Fixed `agentplane upgrade` when repositories still use the deprecated `basilisk-labs/agent-plane` framework source: the upgrade command now normalizes to `basilisk-labs/agentplane` to avoid GitHub API 404s.
- Improved upgrade safety: `.agentplane/config.json` from the upgrade bundle is now ignored to preserve local configuration (a warning is emitted).
- Added best-effort smart merges for policy and agent prompts during upgrades: `AGENTS.md` preserves the Local Overrides block, and `.agentplane/agents/*.json` supports baseline-aware three-way merges to keep user customizations while applying upstream updates.
