# Release Notes — v0.2.11

- Fix Linux CI publish failures caused by tar implementation differences in tests by generating unsafe `.tar.gz` fixtures in-process (no dependency on system `tar`).
- Stabilize `recipes install` security validation tests so path traversal archives are rejected consistently with exit code 3 (E_VALIDATION).
- Improve overall release reliability by removing a CI-only flake in the full test suite.
