# Release Notes — v0.2.20

- Fully refreshed the documentation set across user, developer, and help sections so command behavior, workflow policy, and troubleshooting guidance now match the current CLI implementation.
- Added clearer operational guidance for release execution, including GitHub-only publishing with provenance, local prepublish parity checks, and failure recovery paths.
- Updated backend and support docs to reflect current Redmine env-first configuration, CLI JSON/help behavior, and primary-tag lifecycle policy.
- Reworked recipes and architecture documentation to align with the actual runtime model, artifact paths, and command contracts used in this version.
