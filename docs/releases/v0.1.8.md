# Release Notes — v0.1.8

- Formalized plan approval, verification, and network approval as a first-class task workflow contract (with enforcement in direct and branch workflows).
- Improved write safety by switching more critical files to atomic writes (config, task index, PR artifacts, and caches).
- Added a task README migration command to backfill the new Plan/Verification sections and frontmatter state without losing existing content.
- Hardened network operations to require explicit approval (or `--yes`) when `require_network=true`.
