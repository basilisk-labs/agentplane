Before publishing to production, the website now uses explicit gates:

<!-- truncate -->

1. Docs build and typecheck.
2. Design language compliance.
3. CI contour split validation (docs-only vs core changes).
4. GitHub Pages deployment workflow and domain verification.

This release framing keeps deployment deterministic and auditable.
