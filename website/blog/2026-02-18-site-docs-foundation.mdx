The public website now runs on one Docusaurus runtime with canonical content from repository `docs/`.

<!-- truncate -->

Key decisions:

1. `agentplane.org` hosts both marketing pages and docs (`/docs`).
2. The docs source of truth remains in root `docs/` and is reused directly at build time.
3. Generated reference content is refreshed during docs CI before static site build.
