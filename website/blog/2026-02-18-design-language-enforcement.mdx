AgentPlane website styling now follows `DESIGN.md` as an executable contract.

The docs pipeline runs a design compliance check that rejects:

2. Box shadows outside allowed constraints.
3. Disallowed gradient usage outside approved overlay scope.

This keeps visual drift controlled and review discussions focused on content and structure.
